@W [SYNCHK-77] The top function 'MAT_Multiply' (partB/.settings/matrixmath.c:4) has no outputs. Possible cause(s) are: (1) Output parameters are passed by value; (2) intended outputs (parameters or global variables) are never written; (3) there are infinite loops.
@I [SYNCHK-10] 0 error(s), 1 warning(s).
@W [XFORM-124] Array 'A' (partB/.settings/matrixmath.c:4) may have improper streaming access(es), possible reasons: (1) some entries are accessed more than once; (2) some entries are not used; (3) the entries are not accessed in sequential order.
