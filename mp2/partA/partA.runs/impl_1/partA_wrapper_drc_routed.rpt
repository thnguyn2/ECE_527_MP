Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer dip_sw[1]_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning

Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net delayRamReadCnt_reg[2]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin delayRamReadCnt_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell delayRamReadCnt_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net delayRamReadDone_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin delayRamReadDone_reg_i_2/O, cell delayRamReadDone_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net reg_wea_reg[63]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin reg_wea_reg[63]_i_2/O, cell reg_wea_reg[63]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
