 dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen,
 allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from
 the controlling terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep
 track of the contents of the screen, and thus works best with programs
 that know how to redraw themselves.
 .
 dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its
 support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This
 makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily
 audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in
 environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.

Description-en: Firebird embedded client/server library
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 This package contains libfbembed - the embedded client/server library for
 Firebird.
 .
 It can work with remote Firebird servers (either super-server or classic) via
 TCP connections, in the same way libfbclient does.
 .
 Contrary to libfbclient, libfbembed is not thread-safe.
 .
 When working with local database libfbembed works directly with the database
 file without the need of a separate server process. It needs a separate lock
 manager -- fb_lock_mgr -- which is in firebird2.5-classic package.
 .
 If you are in doubt, you most probably need libfbclient2, instead of this
 package.

 Mason, where you can embed c++ code inside a HTML page to generate
 active content. The ecpp files are precompiled to C++ classes called
 components and compiled and linked into a shared library. This process
 is done at compiletime. The web server Tntnet needs only the compiled
 component library.
 .
 Because the web applications are compiled into native code, they are
 very fast and compact.
 .
 Components can call other components. So you can create building blocks
 of HTML parts and call them in other pages like subprocesses.
 .
 Requests are parsed by tntnet and the request information is easily
 accessible to the components. It supports GET and POST parameters and
 MIME multipart requests for file upload.
 .
 The template language has also support for internationalized
 applications. You can easily create web applications for different
 languages.
 .
 Other features are: cookies, HTTP upload, automatic request parameter
 parsing and conversion, automatic session management, scoped variables
 (application, request and session), internationalisation and keep-alive.
 .
 Logging is done through cxxtools, which provides a unique API for
 log4cpp, log4cxx or simple logging to files or console.
 .
 Tntnet is fully multithreaded and much work has been gone into making
 it scalable. It uses a dynamic pool of worker threads, which answer
 requests from HTTP clients.

Package: swift
Description-md5: 7de15bde951264e5f9603202d2a74a72
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

Package: t1utils
Description-md5: a0f2935a48d84dc957e4ff430839b5e1
Description-en: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.
 .
 This version of the t1utils programs has been maintained by Eddie
 Kohler <eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu> since version 1.5, based on the
 original code by I. Lee Hetherington.  As such, it is a complete
 replacement for the t1utils Debian package, which is based on version
 1.2 of I. Lee Hetherington's code.

Package: tntnet
Description-md5: a5b9e7f5ba86f52c512533172ddaa4eb
Description-en: modular, multithreaded web application server for C++
 Tntnet has a template-language called ecpp similar to PHP, JSP or
 Mason, where you can embed c++ code inside a HTML page to generate
 active content. The ecpp files are precompiled to C++ classes called
 components and compiled and linked into a shared library. This process
 is done at compiletime. The web server Tntnet needs only the compiled
 component library.
 .
 Because the web applications are compiled into native code, they are
 very fast and compact.
 .
 Components can call other components. So you can create building blocks
 of HTML parts and call them in other pages like subprocesses.
 .
 Requests are parsed by tntnet and the request information is easily
 accessible to the components. It supports GET and POST parameters and
 MIME multipart requests for file upload.
 .
 The template language has also support for internationalized
 applications. You can easily create web applications for different
 languages.
 .
 Other features are: cookies, HTTP upload, automatic request parameter
 parsing and conversion, automatic session management, scoped variables
 (application, request and session), internationalisation and keep-alive.
 .
 Logging is done through cxxtools, which provides a unique API for
 log4cpp, log4cxx or simple logging to files or console.
 .
 Tntnet is fully multithreaded and much work has been gone into making
 it scalable. It uses a dynamic pool of worker threads, which answer
 requests from HTTP clients.

Description-en: Xen Hypervisor on i386
 The hypervisor is the "core" for XEN itself.  It gets booted by the boot
 loader and controls cpu and memory, sharing them between your
 administrative domain (Domain 0) and the virtual guest systems.
 .
 In order to boot a XEN system along with this package you also need a
 kernel specifically crafted to work as the Domain 0, mediating hardware
 access for XEN itself.
