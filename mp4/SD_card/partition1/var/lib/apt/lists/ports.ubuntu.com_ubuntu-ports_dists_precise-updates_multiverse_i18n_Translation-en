Description-en: metapackage for AMD/ATI OpenCL-savvy BOINC client and manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (rightously) often find it an unbearable nuissance to
 care for the configuration of BOINC for the OpenCL-savvy AMD/ATI
 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.
 .
 This package is not perfect, yet. A major problem for the moment
 is the availability of the OpenCL driver for 32bit binaries for
 amd64. If this is planned, install the amd-app package provided
 through the AMD developer forum.
