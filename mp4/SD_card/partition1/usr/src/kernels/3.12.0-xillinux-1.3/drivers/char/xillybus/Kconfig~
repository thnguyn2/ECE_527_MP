config XILLYBUS
	tristate "Xillybus Support"
	default m
	help
	  Xillybus is a generic interface for peripherals designed on
	  programmable logic (FPGA). The driver probes the hardware for
	  its capabilities, and creates device files accordingly.

	  If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it:
	  Say N.

config XILLYBUS_PCIE
	bool "Xillybus over PCIe"
	depends on XILLYBUS
	depends on PCI
	default n
	help
	  Set to Y if you want Xillybus to use PCI Express for communicating
	  with the FPGA. This option is harmless, but it requires PCI
	  support on the kernel. Say Y if the target processor supports
	  PCI and/or PCIe.

config XILLYBUS_OF
	bool "Xillybus over Device Tree"
	depends on XILLYBUS
	depends on OF_ADDRESS
	depends on OF_DEVICE
	depends on OF_IRQ
	default y
	help
	  Set to Y if you want Xillybus to find its resources from the
	  Open Firmware Flattened Device Tree. If the target is an embedded
	  system, say Y.  This option is harmless, but it requires Device
	  Tree support on the kernel, which is usually not the case for
	  kernels for fullblown computers.

config XILLYBUS_LITE_OF
	tristate "Xillybus Lite over Device Tree"
	depends on XILLYBUS
	depends on OF_ADDRESS
	depends on OF_DEVICE
	depends on OF_IRQ
	depends on UIO
	default m
	help
	  Set to M to activate Xillybus Lite finding its resources from
	  Open Firmware Flattened Device Tree.
