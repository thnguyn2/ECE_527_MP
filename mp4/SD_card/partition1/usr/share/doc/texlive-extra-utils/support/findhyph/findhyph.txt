NAME
    findhyph -- find words hyphenated by TeX in a document

INSTALLATION
    Copy findhyph or findhyph.bat (depending on OS used) to a directory
    included in system PATH. Perl interpreter is required to be in
    "/usr/bin/" for Unix-like systems or in PATH when using findhyph.bat.

SYNOPSIS
    1)  set "\tracingparagraphs=1" in a TeX document foo.tex and run:

    2)  tex foo.tex

    3)  findhyph [options] foo.log

OPTIONS
    -c  display hyphenated words in context

    -f  display font selectors and other strings starting with a backslash
        character

    -v  display program version

    -p  generate file containing information about one-letter prepositions
        and conjunctions left at the end of line

    -l=STRING
        use prepositions/conjunctions listed in STRING instead of default
        list of prepositions and conjunctions "kKsSvVzZoOuUiIA" used for
        Slovak and Czech language

OUTPUT FILES
    foo.hyph
        List of hyphenated words. All punctuation characters, parentheses
        and other character immediately preceding or following displayed
        words are included in this list. TeX constructs which are too
        difficult to display ("\hbox{}", "\mark{}" etc.) are shown as "[]".
        Math mode is indicated by "$" sign.

        Page numbers in square brackets refer to LOG file and may
        occasionally differ from the typeset document. The reason is that
        TeX may need to break more paragraphs than it would eventually fit
        on the page in order to find a page break.

        Words hyphenated in footnotes are listed before the words hyphenated
        in the paragraph in which the footnote is referenced.

    foo.prep
        List of prepositions if option -p is used.

HISTORY
   1.0 (2001-04-08)
    *   public release

   2.0 (2009-08-10)
    *   fixes in line breaks detection algorithm; support for third pass of
        line breaking algorithm in TeX (positive \emergencystretch); support
        for discretionary breaks in the first pass

    *   page number detection improved (recognized negative page numbers,
        compound page numbers when "\count1" to "\count9" registers are
        non-zero and "[nn{mapfile}]", "[nn<picture>]" and "[nn<newline>"
        formats used by pdfTeX; false page number detection should be much
        more rare)

    *   configurable list of prepositions and conjunctions

    *   hyphenated words can be displayed in context

    *   suggestions and testing by Pavel Striz
