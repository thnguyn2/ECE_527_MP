ps2eps for Debian
-----------------

Both the ps2eps acript and the source file bbox.c have been changed to send
the output of the -h, -L, and -V options to the standard output instead of
the standard error.  This is the practice recommended by the GNU Coding
Standards.

Thanks to Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca> for the thorough review
of an early version of this package.
