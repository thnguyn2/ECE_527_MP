libavl for Debian
-----------------

Please note that this library is made by Wessel Dankers, and is not related to
the GNU AVL library by Ben Pfaff.  There are a lot of AVL libraries around, all
with different feature sets. If other AVL libraries are packaged for Debian
then the name of this package and the library it contains might change.
