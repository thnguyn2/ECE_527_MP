Upstream-Name: pxljr
Source: http://hp-pxl-jetready.sourceforge.net/
 The original tarball (as imported from Ubuntu) was in fact the
 pxljr-1.3_wlibjpeg.tar.gz, that embeds libjpeg6b.
 .
 This tarball has been repacked to remove the libjpeg6b and the libijs source
 files that were included. While the code from both libraries is free software
 and could be shipped in this source tarball, it was found more convenient to
 make sure the actual files don't appear in the tarball and thus cannot be
 used in the building process.

 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept

 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,

 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
 but is also freely distributable.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
