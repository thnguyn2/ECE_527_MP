FONTOOLS: some tools for handling fonts with LaTeX and fontinst
===============================================================

This package provides a few tools to simplify using fonts (especially
TrueType/OpenType ones) with LaTeX.

The most important tool in this bundle is

AUTOINST - a wrapper script around Eddie Kohler's LCDF TypeTools for 
installing OpenType fonts in LaTeX. It also creates .fd and .sty files.

The other tools in this bundle were created before I knew of the
TypeTools' existence. They clumsily implement a subset of the 
functionality of the TypeTools and should be considered more or less
deprecated. Personally, I haven't used them in years (and I'm not sure
I still understand how the code exactly works), but they're still
included in case someone needs them. Just be aware that I may not
be able to fix any problems you may encounter.

AFM2AFM - reencode .afm files; designed to replace fontinst's
\reencodefont for big .afm files.

AUTOINST - a wrapper script around otftotfm for installing
OpenType fonts in LaTeX. It also creates .fd and .sty files.

CMAP2ENC - convert glyph indices in TrueType fonts without glyph names
(such as Linotype Palatino) to Adobe glyph names.

FONT2AFM - create font metrics for just about any font file; wrapper
around tools such as pf2afm, ttf2afm, pfm2kpx and ot2kpx.

OT2KPX - extract all kerning pairs from OpenType fonts.

PFM2KPX - extract the correct kerning pairs from buggy .pfm files
(where pf2afm complains `.notdef character occurred among kern pairs').

SHOWGLYPHS - create a pdf file that shows all glyphs in a font.


Please see the documentation of the individual programs for more info.


Prerequisites
-------------

All programs have been written in Perl; they require Perl version 5.6 or later. 
Some programs also need pf2afm (distributed with GhostScript), ttf2afm
(distributed with pdfTeX) or Eddie Kohler's TypeTools (see
http://www.lcdf.org/type/)

Most tools can also use kpsewhich or findtexmf (if available) for searching 
their input files. If neither tool is present, input files are searched 
in the current working directory.

The SHOWGLYPHS script uses several standard Unix/Linux commands; 
it probably won't work on other platforms. It also needs a working,
TDS-compliant TeX installation.

The encoding files in the `share/' directory are meant to be used with 
Eddie Kohler's otftotfm (either directly or via the AUTOINST wrapper script);
place these files somewhere where otftotfm can find them.

Examples
--------

A few detailed examples of the use of some of these tools (mainly CMAP2ENC)
can be found in the directory `examples/': this contains everything you need
(except the fonts themselves, of course) to use the TrueType versions of
Linotype Palatino, Monotype Berling and Linotype Frutiger that come with
some Microsoft products.
