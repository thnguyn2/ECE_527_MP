pgfplots - A tool to work with scientific data. It draws normal and/or
logarithmic plots in LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.  

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds and formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

Pgfplots draws high-quality function plots in normal or logarithmic
scaling with a user-friendly interface. The user supplies axis labels, legend
entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and Pgfplots applies
axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the plots.
It is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ.

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing.
