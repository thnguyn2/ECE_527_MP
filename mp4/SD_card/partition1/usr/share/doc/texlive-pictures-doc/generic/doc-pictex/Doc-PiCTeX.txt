                    DOCUMENTATION for PiCTeX

1. The macro file pictex.tex (or pictexwd.tex) contains a sober yet 
comprehensive documentation. (Something similar holds for contributions 
from other authors.)

2. Michael Wichura presented a description in TUGboat 9 (2), pp. 193-197 
(1988), see 

      http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb09-2/tb21wichura-pictex.pdf

3. Michael Wichura's MANUAL -- today called `PiCTeX and Table Manual' -- 
is distributed by PCTeX: 

      http://www.pctex.com/books.html

4. Other overviews have been presented at least in Helmut Kopka's GERMAN 
books on LaTeX extensions in the 1990s. [Lazy, I know.]

5. Another GERMAN reference list, a quite RECENT one, is Uwe Siart's PDF 
on the web at

      http://www.siart.de/typografie/pictex-referenz.pdf

6. An early command summary has been Angus Duggan's PDF on the web at 

      http://mirror.ctan.org/info/pictex/summary/pictexsum.pdf

7. You may like short descriptions of pictex including HINTS concerning 
basic problems with PiCTeX
