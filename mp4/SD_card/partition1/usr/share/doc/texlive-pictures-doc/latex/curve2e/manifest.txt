The package bundle curve2e is composed of the following files

curve2e.ins

curve2e.dtx is the documented source file of package curve2e.sty; you get
curve2e.sty by running tex or latex on curve2e.ins.
You get the documentation by running latex on curve2e.dtx; curve2e.pdf already
contains the documentation in pdf format.

README (or Readme or readme depending on the operating system) contains general 
information

The package has the lppl status of author maintained.

Nevertheless this package is an extension to the standard LaTeX package pict2e,
so that this file is first of all submitted to the authors of pict2e, in case
they wanted to incorporate part or all of its contents in the official package
they maintain. Therefore any change must be controlled against the parent
package pict2e so as to avoid redefining what has already been incorporated in
the official package. Their e-mails are

Rolf Niepraschk, Rolf.Niepraschk@ptb.de
Hubert Gaesslein, HubertJG@open.mind.de


If you prefer sending me your modifications, as long as I will maintain this
package, I will forward every (documented) suggestion or modification to the
authors of pict2e.
