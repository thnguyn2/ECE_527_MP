\section{Memory and Speed considerations}
\label{sec:pgfplots:optimization}
\PGFPlots\ can typeset plots with several thousand points if memory limits of \TeX\ are configured properly. Its runtime is roughly proportional to the number of input points\footnote{In fact, the runtime is pseudo--linear: starting with about $100{,}000$ points, it will become quadratic. This limitation applies to the path length of \PGF\ paths as well. Furthermore, the linear runtime is not possible yet for stacked plots.}.

\PGFPlots\ relies completely on \TeX\ to do all typesetting. It uses the front-end-layer and basic layer of \PGF\ to perform all drawing operations. For complicated plots, this may take some time, and you may want to read section~\ref{sec:pgfplots:importexport} for how to write single figures to external graphics files. Externalization is the best way to reduce typesetting time.

However, for large scale plots with a lot of points, limitations of \TeX's capacities are reached easily.

\subsection{Memory limitations}
The default settings of most \TeX-distributions are quite restrictive, so it may be necessary to adjust them. For Mik\TeX, this can be done using simple command line switches:
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
pdflatex 
	--stack-size=n --save-size=n 
	--main-memory=n --extra-mem-top=n --extra-mem-bot=n
	--pool-size=n --max-strings=n 
\end{codeexample}
\noindent Experiment with these settings if Mik\TeX\ runs out of memory. 

Usually, the log--file contains a summary about the used ressources, giving a hint which parameter needs to be increased. For Unix installations, one needs to adjust config files. This can be done as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Locate |texmf.cnf| on your system. On my Ubuntu installation, it is in 
	
	|/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf|.
	\item Either change |texmf.cnf| directly, or copy it to some convenient place. If you copy it, here is how to proceed:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item keep only the changed entries in your local copy to reduce conflicts. \TeX\ will always read \emph{all} config files found in its search path.
			\item Adjust the search path to find your local copy. This can be done using the environment variable |TEXMFCNF|. Assuming your local copy is in |~/texmf/mytexcnf/texmf.cnf|, you can write
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
export TEXMFCNF=~/texmf/mytexcnf:
\end{codeexample}
			to search first in your directory, then in all other system directories.
		\end{itemize}
	\item You should change the entries
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
main_memory = n
extra_mem_top = n
extra_mem_bot = n
max_strings = n
param_size = n
save_size = n
stack_size = n
\end{codeexample}
		The log--file usually contains information about the parameter which needs to be enlarged.
\end{enumerate}
Unfortunately, \TeX\ does not allow arbitrary memory limits, there is an upper bound hard coded in the executables.
