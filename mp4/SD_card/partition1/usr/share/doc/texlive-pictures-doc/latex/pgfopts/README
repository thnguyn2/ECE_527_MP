Using key-value options for packages and macros is a good way
of handling large numbers of options with a clean interface.
The pgfkeys package provides a very well designed system for
defining and using keys, but does not make this available for
handling LaTeX class and package options.  The pgfopts package
adds this ability to pgfkeys, in the same way that kvoptions
extends the keyval package.
