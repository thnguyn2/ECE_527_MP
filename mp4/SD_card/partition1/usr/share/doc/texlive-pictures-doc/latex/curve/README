* Description
=============

CurVe is a class package that hopefully will make your life easier when you
want to write your CV. It provides you with a set of commands to create
rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe will then properly format your CV
for you (possibly splitting it onto multiple pages, repeating the titles etc),
which is usually the most painful part of CV writing. Another nice feature of
CurVe is its ability to manage different CV "flavors" simultaneously. It is in
fact often the case that you want to maintain slightly divergent versions of
your CV at the same time, in order to emphasize on different aspects of your
background. CurVe also comes with support for AUC-TeX.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `curve.ins' to create the class file `curve.cls'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `curve.dtx' to create the doc   file `curve.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `curve.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

	Once you have installed the package, you might also want to process
the example file cv.tex. This will give you an idea of what a CV looks like
with CurVe by default.

	Have fun!
