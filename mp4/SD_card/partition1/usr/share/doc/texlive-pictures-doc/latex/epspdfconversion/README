This package facilitates the use of the epspdf tools (on
CTAN in pub/tex/support) from within PDFLaTeX. EPS graphic
files are converted "on the fly". It is similar to and based
on the epstopdf package and allows to pass several options
such as grayscale, prepress, pdfversion etc. to the epspdf
conversion-command.
