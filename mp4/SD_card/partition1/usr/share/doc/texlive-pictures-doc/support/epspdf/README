Epspdf is an ps/eps/pdf converter which can be used both from the
command-line and as a GUI application.

Full documentation is available in the doc subdirectory.

Windows users: you may prefer the Windows setup program available
from http://tex.aanhet.net/epspdf/ or on CTAN as part of
epspdf-extra. This setup program includes a minimal subset of Ruby/Tk,
whereas this version requires separate installation of Ruby, and for
the GUI also Tcl/Tk.

Mac users: you may want to have a look at epspdf_app, a very simple
AppleScript applet for starting epspdftk.rb by double-clicking. Also
available from http://tex.aanhet.net/epspdf/ or on CTAN as part of
epspdf-extra.

The files in the texlive subdirectory are NOT useful for a
standalone installation. They are wrapper scripts for
embedding epspdf and epspdftk into TeX Live.
