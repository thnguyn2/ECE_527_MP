
The pst-asr package is based on PSTricks and is intended to be
used by linguists to typeset autosegmental representations. The
core files are 1) pst-asr.tex, the Tex macro file, 2)
pst-asr.sty, a LaTex wrapper which calls pst-asr.tex, and 3)
pst-asr-doc.pdf, the documentation.  The complete Tex source for
the documentation is zipped into pst-asr-doc-source.zip along
with README.txt, which has instructions for generating the
documentation.

The file pst-asr-examples.tex is a LaTex file which contains
almost all the examples in the documentation, very simply
formatted (no packages other than pstricks, pst-xkey, and pst-asr
are used) in order to facilitate user experimentation with
pst-asr typesetting.  Users should be able to run this file with
little difficulty if pst-asr is fully installed or is simply
in the same directory that pst-asr-examples.tex is in.
pst-asr-examples.pdf shows what the source produces.
