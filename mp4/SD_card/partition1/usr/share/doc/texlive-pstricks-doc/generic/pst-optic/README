Save the files

pst-optic.sty
pst-optic.tex

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.
If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-optic-doc.tex
bibtex pst-optic.doc
latex pst-optic-doc.tex
dvips pst-optic-doc.dvi

to get a PostScript file. But pay attention, that the pst-optic
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

It is nearly the same for the example file pst-optic-examples.tex

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code, like the one from KDE.

For another PDF output read the Introduction from
the documentation.
