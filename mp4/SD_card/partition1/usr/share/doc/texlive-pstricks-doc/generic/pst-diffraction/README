PSTricks offers excellent macros to insert more or less complex 
graphics into a document. pstricks.tex itself is the base for several 
other additional packages, which are mostly named pst-xxxx, 
like pst-diffraction. 
Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with wave propagation, 
such as the bending, spreading and interference of waves passing by an object 
or aperture that disrupts the wave, like rectangle, circular, or tringle
slits.

Save the files

pst-diffraction.sty 
pst-diffraction.tex
pst-diffraction.pro

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.
The pro file should go into $TEXMF$/dvips/pstricks/.

pst-diffraction uses the extended version of the keyval package. So
be sure that you 
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pst-diffraction, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex

You can run the documentation with 
make DE
make E
make FR

or for all make all  ;-) this will take a lot of time, because
the images are very big.

If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-diffraction-docX.tex
bibtex pst-diffraction-docX
latex pst-diffraction-docX.tex
dvips pst-diffraction-docX.dvi

to get a PostScript file. But pay attention, that the pst-diffraction
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code.

For another PDF output read the introduction from
the documentation.
