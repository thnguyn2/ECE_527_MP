To install the package run
latex pst-3d.ins

and install the generated packages in a directory, which is in
the search path of TeX 

This version of pst-3d uses the extended version of the keyval 
package. So be sure that you 
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey.tex
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pst-3d, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex
