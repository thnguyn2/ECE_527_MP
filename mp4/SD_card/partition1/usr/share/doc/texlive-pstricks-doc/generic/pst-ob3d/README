| pst-ob3d: PSTricks package for 3D objects       |
---------------------------------------------------

Run the Makefile or alternative:

* Run "tex" on pst-ob3d.ins and copy pst-ob3d.tex and pst-ob3d.sty
  in one of your TeX input directories

* Run "latex" on pst-ob3d.dtx to generate the documentation

* This is a PSTricks (PostScript Tricks) package, which won't
  run with pdftex. In this case go to http://PSTricks.de/
  for some help.
