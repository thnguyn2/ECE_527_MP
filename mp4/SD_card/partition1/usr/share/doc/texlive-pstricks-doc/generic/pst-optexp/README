The package pst-optexp is a collection of optical components
that facilitate easy sketching of optical experimental
setups. Mechanisms for proper alignment of different components are
provided internally. This way the user does not have to care for proper
orientation of the elements.

This is version 2.0
For a changelog see file Changes

Save the files

pst-optexp.sty 
pst-optexp.tex
pst-optexp.pro

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.
The pro file should go into $TEXMF$/dvips/pstricks/.

pst-optexp uses the extended version of the keyval package. So
be sure that you 
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pst-optexp, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex
