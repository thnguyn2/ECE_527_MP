  * Install pst-ghsb.sty and pst-ghsb.tex in one of your TeX input directories

  * Install pst-ghsb.pro in one of your DVI to PostScript converter input
directories

  * As the programmation and usage are stricly modeled on the `pst-grad'
package, there is no documentation but only two test files: t-ghsb.tex
and t2-ghsb.tex

  * It must be considered today (September, 1998) as superceded
by the `pst-slpe' package from Martin Giese. Users of `pst-ghsb'
are encouraged to migrate.
