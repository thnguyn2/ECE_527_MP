used by linguists to typeset complex trees. The core files are 1)
pst-jtree.tex, the Tex macro file, 2) pst-jtree.sty, a LaTex
wrapper which calls pst-jtree.tex, and 3) pst-jtree-doc.pdf, the
documentation.  The complete Tex source for the documentation is
in the file pst-jtree-doc-source.zip.

The file pst-jtree-examples.tex is a LaTex file which contains
all the complex examples in the documentation, as well as many of
the simpler ones.  It very simply formatted (no packages other
than pstricks, pst-xkey, and pst-jtree are used) in order to
facilitate user experimentation with pst-jtree typesetting.
Provided that PSTricks and PST-XKey are installed, users should
be able to run this file with little difficulty if PST-jTree is
installed or simply if pst-jtree.tex and pst-jtree.sty are in the
same directory that pst-jtree-examples.tex is in.
pst-jtree-examples.pdf shows what the source produces.
For those interested in tree formatting but not LaTex,
pst-jtree-examples.tex can be very simply converted into a Tex
file.
