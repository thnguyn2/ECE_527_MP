\section{Presentation}


The package allows the representation and manipulation of some
simple objects in two dimensions (2D). The macro \Lcs{psProjection}
can project these 2D objects onto a chosen plane.

The syntax is analogous to that of \Lcs{psSolid}, with an
obligatory option \Lkeyword{object}, that allows us to specify
the type of object to be projected.

The general syntax is \texttt{\textbackslash
psSolid[object=objectname,plan=plantype,<options>](x,y)}
