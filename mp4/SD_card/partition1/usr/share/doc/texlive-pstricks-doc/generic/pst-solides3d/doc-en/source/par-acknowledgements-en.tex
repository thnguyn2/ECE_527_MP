\section{Acknowledgments}

Spontaneous and diligent proofreading assistance from various
members of the PSTricks list made it possible to produce this
English version of the \texttt{pst-solides3d} documentation. We
hope that this will help and encourage more of you to set about
depicting your own 3D solids.

So, many thanks from the ``\'{e}quipe solide'' go to: % here ``\'{e}quipe solide'' is meant as a nice word game...

Additional thanks go to Gerry \textsc{Coombes}, who generated a keyword glossary
for the \texttt{pst-solides3d} package and who proofed the terminology for consistency.
