pst-sigsys package  2009/04/01 v1.1
----------------------------------
The pst-sigsys is a collection of useful macros for disciplines related to signal processing. It defines macros for plotting a sequence of numbers, drawing the pole-zero diagram of a system, shading the region of convergence, creating an adder or a multiplier node, placing a framed node at a given coordinate, creating an up-sampler or a down-sampler node, and connecting a list of nodes using any node-connecting macro.
