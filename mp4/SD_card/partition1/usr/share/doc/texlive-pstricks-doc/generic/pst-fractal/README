Save the files

pst-fractal.sty 
pst-fractal.tex

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.

pst-fractal uses the extended version of the keyval package. So
be sure that you 
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pst-fractal, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex, eg. pst-node or pst-plot.


If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-fractal-doc.tex
bibtex pst-fractal.doc
latex pst-fractal-doc.tex
dvips pst-fractal-doc.dvi
ps2pdf pst-fractal-doc.ps  (takes a long time!!!)

to get a PostScript or PDF file. But pay attention, that the pst-fractal
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code.

For another PDF output read the section from the documentation.
