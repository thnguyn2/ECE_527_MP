% the big problem with pdflatex is that pst-uml make use of pstricks
% package which use special TeX command to output directly postscript code.
% So pst-uml doesn't work with pdftex :-(
% sorry about that.
% 
% However, as I'm switching from LaTeX to ConTeXt
% (another more modern macro set TeX package)
% I also have the problem to port old pstricks figures
% of mine to be used with ConTeXt (which use pdfetex)
% So instead of using inline pstrick command in LaTeX,
% I make each figure independant in a separate LaTeX file.
% Then I make eps, then pdf file that I include 
% in my main xTeX document.
% 
% This "figure only" latex file can be compile by :
% 
%     latex fig.tex
%     dvips -E fig.dvi  -o fig.eps
%     epstopdf fig.eps 
%     rm fig.log fig.aux fig.dvi fig.eps
%     rm fig.pdf
