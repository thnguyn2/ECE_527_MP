This package draws uniform, cubic Bspline curves, open and closed, based on a sequence of Bspline control points. There is also code which permits drawing the open or closed cubic Bspline curve interplating a sequence of points.

The .tex and .sty files should be installed in a folder searched by TeX. All documentation is in pst-bspline-doc.pdf.
