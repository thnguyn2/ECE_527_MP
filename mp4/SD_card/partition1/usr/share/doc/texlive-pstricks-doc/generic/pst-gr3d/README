  * Run "tex" on pst-gr3d.ins and copy pst-gr3d.tex and pst-gr3d.sty
in one of your TeX input directories

  * Run "latex" on pst-gr3d.dtx to generate the documentation

  * The 1.3x versions have an incompatility with the previous ones
(the coordinates used are now as the PSTricks ones, and must not be
increased by one as in the previous versions)
