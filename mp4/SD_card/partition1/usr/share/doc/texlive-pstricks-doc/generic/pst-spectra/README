INSTALLATION
------------

Save the files

pst-spectra uses the extended version of the keyval package. So
be sure that you
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pst-spectra, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex
