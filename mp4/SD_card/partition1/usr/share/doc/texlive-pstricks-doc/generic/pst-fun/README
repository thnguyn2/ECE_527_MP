pst-fun: plotting special funny objects, like Bill from Gaucho brothers

Save the files pst-fun.sty|tex in a directory, which is part of your 
local TeX tree. The pro file should go into $TEXMF/dvips/pstricks/
Then do not forget to run texhash to update this tree.
For more information  see the documentation of your LATEX distribution 
on installing packages into your local TeX system or read the 
TeX Frequently Asked Questions:
(http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages).

PSTricks is PostScript Tricks, the documentation cannot be run
with pdftex, use the sequence latex->dvips->ps2pdf.
