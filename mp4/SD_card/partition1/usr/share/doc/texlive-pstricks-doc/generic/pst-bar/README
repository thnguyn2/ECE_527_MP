With pst-bar, one may use pstricks to produce bar charts directly from a data
file. This package is still in the beta stage --- the usual caveats pertaining
to beta software apply. Additional features and improved (in both content and
layout) documentation will be provided as the code stabilizes.

INSTALLATION:

pst-bar consists of three files: pst-bar.sty, pst-bar.tex, and pst-bar.pro.
Place the first two anywhere your installation can find them (typically
$LOCALTEXMF/tex/latex/pst-bar for pst-bar.sty and
$LOCALTEXMF/tex/generic/pst-bar for pst-bar.tex). Place pst-bar.pro where dvips
can find it, typically in the pstricks subdirectory of your dvips directory
(i.e., $LOCALTEXMF/dvips/pstricks).

DOCUMENTATION:

See pst-bar-doc.ps or pst-bar-doc.pdf for details on using pst-bar.
