The auto-pst-pdf package
v0.6          2009/04/26

This package uses -shell-escape (or "write18") to
automatically perform the extra compilations
required for the "pst-pdf" package.

This makes it especially easy to integrate into the
workflow of an editor with just "LaTeX" and "pdfLaTeX"
buttons.

Wrappers are provided for various psfrag-related
features so that Matlab figures via laprint, Mathematica
figures via MathPSfrag, and regular psfrag figures can
all be input consistently and easily.
