PSBAO is a LaTeX2e package to draw Bao diagrams in LaTeX. It has been created
using the Go package written by Victor Bos (September 4, 2008) as basis and it
is built on top of the PSTricks package.

To all the people who have never played bao I suggest to visit:
http://www.swahili.it/bao.

To install the package, place the file psbao.sty in a directory where
LaTeX can find it. That is, it should be somewhere on TEXINPUTS.

For more information, see the manual (psbaomanual.{pdf,tex}).
