This is a short compilation of nice things we could to improve rhythmbox in
Debian.

- more mailcap entries, /usr/lib/mime/packages/rhythmbox only lists some known
  types, but the list is not exhaustive

- reportbug plugin, most users can't diagnostic wether problems are coming from
  gstreamer or from rhythmbox itself, it would be nice to extend reportbug to
  do some basic tests or to print a message

- vala support
