The plays of Shakespeare have been marked up by Jon Bosak. This xmltex 
package attempts to typeset them. The plays themselves can be got from
  http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/bosakShakespeare200.html

You will also need the `play' latex class, from CTAN.

This is an experimental package. Feel free to improve it as you see fit.
There are a number of shortcomings with this package (but I'm not going to 
tell you what they are and spoil the fun!).  Let me know how you get on.
