Tabbing to fixed positions in a paragraph.

Two new text positioning commands are defined: \tabto and \tab.

\tabto{<length>}

Tab to a position relative to the left margin in a paragraph
(any indentation due to a list is part of the `margin' in this
context).  If the text on the line already goes past the desired
position, the tab starts a new line and moves to the requested
horizontal  position.

\tabto*{<length>}

Similar to \tabto, except it will perform backspacing, and over-
print previous text on the line whenever that text is already
longer than the specified length (i.e., no linebreak is produced).
Line-breaks are suppressed immediately after \tabto or \tabto*.

\tab

Tab to the next tab-stop chosen from a list of tab positions, in
the traditional style of typewriters.  A \tab will always move
to the next tab stop (or the next line), even if it is already
exactly at a tab stop. Thus, "\tab\tab" skips a position.  A
linebreak is permitted immediately following a \tab, in case the
ensuing text does not fit well in the remaining space.

The tab-stop positions are declared using either \TabPositions
or \NumTabs:

\TabPositions{<length>, <length>,...<length>}

Declares the tab stops as a comma-separated list of positions 
relative to the left margin. A tab-stop at 0pt is implicit, and 
need not be listed.

\NumTabs{<number>}

Declares a list of <number> equally-spaced tabs, starting at the
left margin and spanning \linewidth.  For example \NumTabs{2} 
declares tab-stops at 0pt and 0.5\linewidth, the same as
\TabPositions{0pt, 0.5\linewidth} or \TabPositions{0.5\linewidth}
