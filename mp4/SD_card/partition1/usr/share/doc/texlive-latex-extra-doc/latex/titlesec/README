Titlesec package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This package allows to change the sectioning titles.  Amongst its many 
features it provides margin titles, different format in left and right 
pages, rules above and below the title, etc.

Current version is 2.8.

Titletoc package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For toc entries formatting, providing the possibility of changing
the format in the middle of a document, grouping the entries
in a single paragraph, pretty free-forms entries, partial tocs, etc.
 
The titletoc.sty file is not part of the titlesec package; it's
an independent package, but it's described in titlesec.tex.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
No .ins/.dtx preinstalation is required.  Move the files to a place 
where LaTeX can find them and typeset titlesec.tex.  All of files in 
this directory are necessary for titlesec.sty to work, except the 
manual titlesec.tex (and this 'readme' file). The manual requires
titlesec.sty and titletoc.sty, and hence all the .tss and .def 
files as well.

Files with extension .new (titlesec.new and titletoc.new) 
used to be patch files, ie, files with bug fixes, which were
loaded automatically. Since titlesec 2.7 (titletoc 1.6), these
files do not exist any more and should be removed (however,
they will be ignored if present).

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~
Some language styles (for babel) add the indentation
after a section in a so radical way that titlesec (which
uses the internal LaTeX macros) cannot supress it again.
For example, spanish (fixed in version 5.0) and frenchb.
