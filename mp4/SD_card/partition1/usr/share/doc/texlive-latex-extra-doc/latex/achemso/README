The achemso bundle provides a LaTeX class file and BibTeX style
file in accordance with the requirements of the American
Chemical Society (ACS).  The files can be used for any documents,
but have been carefully designed and tested to be suitable for
submission to ACS journals.

The bundle also includes the natmove package.  This package is
loaded by achemso, and provides automatic moving of superscript
citations after punctuation.
