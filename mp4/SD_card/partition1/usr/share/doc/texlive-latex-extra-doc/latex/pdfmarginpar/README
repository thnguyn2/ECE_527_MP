pdfmarginpar provides the \pdfmarginpar command which is
similar in spirit to \marginpar. How-
ever, it creates pdf-annotations which can be viewed with
Adobe Reader instead of normal text margins:
small icons indicate the in-text position where the message
originates, popups provide detailed messages.
The advantage over \marginpar is that bugﬁxes and
communication is clearly visible together with its
text source and the document as such is not obscured.
