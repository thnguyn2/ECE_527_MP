The timesheet package provides a style and macro for
generating simple timesheets for specified dates.
This package also requires the array and longtable
packages from the LaTeX2e distribution on CTAN, and
the calendar package that can be found in the
LaTeX2e "contrib/other" hierarchy.  The package
was put together by Frank Bennett on 9 November 1996.

This package demonstrates how the calendar package
can be put to use in generating calendars and other
documents that apply a template to a list of dates.

The current version is v0.02.
