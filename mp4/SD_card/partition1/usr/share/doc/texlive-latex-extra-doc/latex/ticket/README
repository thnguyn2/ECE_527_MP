Idea of ticket:
ticket.sty provides an easy to handle interface to produce 
visiting cards, labels for your files, stickers, pins and
other stuff for your office, conferences etc.
All you need is a definition of your "ticket" included in
a ticket definition file  and the two commands 
\ticketdefault and \ticket.
