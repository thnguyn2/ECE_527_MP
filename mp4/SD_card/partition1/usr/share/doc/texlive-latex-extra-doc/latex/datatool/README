datatool.sty:

 Databases can be created using LaTeX commands or loaded
 from external ASCII files, such as comma or tab separated
 variable files.

 Databases can be sorted numerically or alphabetically
 (descending or ascending.)

 Repetitive operations can be performed on each row of
 data in a database (such as mail merging.) Conditions
 can be imposed to exclude rows.

 Commands are provided to determine if an argument is
 an integer, a real number, currency or a string.
 (Scientific notation is currently not supported.)

 Locale dependent number settings are supported 
 (such as a comma as a decimal character and full stop as 
 a number group character.)

 Commands are provided to convert between locale dependent
 numbers/currency and the standard decimal format required 
 by the fp package enabling fixed point arithmetic to be 
 performed on elements of the database.

 Strings can be tested to determine if they are all upper
 or all lower case.

 Names can be converted to initials using \DTLinitials.
