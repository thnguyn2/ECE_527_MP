=============================================================================

This package was developed as a typographers toolbox offering the most 
important features for everyday work. First it allows setting the paper size 
as well as the page layout. The next important feature is the ability of 
printing crop marks both with TeX + dvips or (x)dvipdfm(x) and with pdfTeX. 
Finally it is possible to reflect pages both horizontally and vertically.
