The description from TeX catalogue online:
------------------------------------------

The package was inspired by the cooltooltips package. In contrast to
cooltooltips, fancytooltips allows inclusion of tooltips which contain
arbitrary TeX material or a series of TeX materials (aminated
graphics) from an external PDF file. To see the tooltips, you have to
open the files in Adobe Reader. The links and JavaScripts are inserted
using eforms package from the AcroTeX bundle.
