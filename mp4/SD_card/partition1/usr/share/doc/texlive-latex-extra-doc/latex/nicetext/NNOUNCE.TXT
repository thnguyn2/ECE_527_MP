'fifinddo' & 'makedoc' -- string substitution and "txt->TeX" by LaTeX
======================================================================
The NICETEXT bundle offers ``minimal'' markup syntax for restricted
kinds of text: There should not be much more characters typed than 
printed! (though keeping LaTeX quality.) No more backslashes, 
technical terms, and curly braces! (so clumsy on PC keyboards) ...

Main focus now is easy *documentation of LaTeX packages*. 
Preprocessing by 'Perl' or so is replaced by TeX macros 
(reviving/generalizing the 'docstrip' idea). 

'fifinddo.sty' provides setup for txt -> TeX preprocessing macros 
including *expandable* sequences of safe, correct string substitions. 
'fifinddo.pdf' mathematically characterizes wrong substring 
detection by 'substr.sty' as well as by LaTeX's internal `\in@'. 

There is a script language for detecting package code and 
documentation and for supplying plain text with typographical markup 
('makedoc.sty', 'mdcorr.cfg').

CATALOGUE: These packages might be compared with:
- easylatex, txt2latex, txt2tex 
  (typographical and TeX input enhancement); 
- doc, gmdoc, lineno (\DocInput); 
- substr, datatool, xstring, stringstrings, makematch, ... (parsing)
