Idea of ifmslide:
Make presentations not only for the screen or a beamer (pdflatex) but
for printed slides (latex) too without changing something* in your document
and without problems getting any well sized print-format.

(*only add the display option...)

Content:

README ............... this file

ifmslide.sty ......... the style file
ifmslide.cfg ......... it's configuration

ifmman.pdf
ifmman.tex
ifmman.dvi ........... the documentation and samples

button??.[pdf,eps] ... buttons for use with the style
genbutton ............ perl-script to generate new buttons

ifmlogoc.[pdf,eps] ... The non-official logo of our institute ;-)

liquid_helium.[eps,jpg]
aqua_ravines.[eps,jpg]
              ........ two "tiles" out of KDE as example for 
                       the \paneltile-command

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All documentation is currently in ifmman.tex
To get a readable version, just use pdflatex ifmman.tex, or load
it down from your favorite tex-server...

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Hint:

Use the environment variable TEXPSHEADERS in addition to TEXINPUTS
if files like graphics are not found with pdflatex.
I think that is a problem of tetex in the current release only?
