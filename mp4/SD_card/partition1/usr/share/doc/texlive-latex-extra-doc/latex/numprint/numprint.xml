Print numbers with a separator every three digits and convert numbers
given as 12345.6e789 to 12\,345,6\cdot 10^{789}. Numbers are printed
in the current mode (text or math) in order to use the correct font.
  Many things, including the decimal sign, the thousand separator, as
well as the product sign can be changed by the user, e.g., to reach
12,345.6\times 10^{789}. If requested, numprint can round numbers to
a given number of digits.
  If an optional argument is given it is printed upright as unit.
Numbers can be rounded to a given number of digits.
  The package supports an automatic, language-dependent change of the
number format.
  Tabular alignment using the tabular(*), array, tabularx, and longtable
environments (similar to the dcolumn and rccol packages) is supported
using all features of numprint. Additional text can be added before and
after the formatted number.
