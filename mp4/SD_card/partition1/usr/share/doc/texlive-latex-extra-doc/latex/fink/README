* Description
=============

	This package looks over your shoulder and keeps track of files
\input'ed (the LaTeX way) or \include'ed in your document. You then have a
permanent access to the directory, name and extension of the file currently
being processed through several macros. FiNK also comes with support for
AUC-TeX.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `fink.ins' to create the style file `fink.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `fink.dtx' to create the doc   file `fink.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fink^H^H^H^Hfit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `fink.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.


	Have fun!
