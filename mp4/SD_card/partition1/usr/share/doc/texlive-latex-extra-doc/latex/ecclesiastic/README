This style file is for modifying the way the latin option to the babel 
package operates when typesetting Latin. The style is in some way 
"frenchizied" for what concerns punctuation spacings and footnote 
style, and shortcuts are available in order to set accents on all 
vowels, including y and the diphthongs ae and oe.
