This is version 0.6 of the isodoc class

The isodoc class can be used for the preparation of letters,
invoices, and, in the future, similar documents. Documents are set
up with options, thus making the class easily adaptable to user’s
wishes and extensible for other document types.
Victor Eijkhout’s NTG brief class, which implements the NEN1026
standard, was the starting point.
