Description:
------------
listofsymbols provides commands to (a) automatically create a list of symbols (also called notation or nomenclature) and (b) handle symbols logically, i.e. define a macro that is expanded to the desired output and use the macro in the text rather than `hardcoding' the output into the text.
 
This helps to ensure consistency throughout the text, especially if there is a chance that symbols will be changed at some stage.
 
This package is more or less a combination of what the packages nomencl.sty and formula.sty do. The concept of creating the list of symbols, though, is different from the way nomencl.sty does it.
