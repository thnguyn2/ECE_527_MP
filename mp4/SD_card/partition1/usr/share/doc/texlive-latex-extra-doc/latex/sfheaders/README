This style file  (for LaTeX-2e)  borrows some definitions  from the
standard article/report/book classes; and modifies them in order to
print the part(*), chapter(*), section, subsection ... headers with
the Sans-Serif variant of the current font.

(*) Some standard classes do not have these headers
