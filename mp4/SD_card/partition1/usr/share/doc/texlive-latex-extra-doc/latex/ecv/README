              -----------------------------
              Version 0.1 of the ecv class
               C. Neumann, B. Haberstumpf
              -----------------------------

This LaTeX provides a simple environment for laying out a
fancy curriculum vitae with LaTeX. The class is intended
to be self-contained so it should not be necessary to fiddle
around with thousand other packages to get a nicely 
formatted CV.

As this class is created mainly for ourselves it does not
contain evil low-level TeX magic but instead uses many other
fancy LaTeX packages that we hope you have already installed.


Required Packages
-----------------

In detail the following packages are loaded by the ecv class:

  ifthen
  geometry
  longtable
  pgf
  paralist
  helvet
  color
  fancyhdr
  inputenc
  fontenc
  ae
  aecompl
  aeguill

  babel

These packages can be obtained of course from http://www.ctan.org/.


Installation
------------

After unzipping the package call:

  $ latex ecv.ins

This will be extract some files (ecv.cls, ecvNLS.sty...). Create a
directory beneath your TeX installation preferably create 

  tex/latex/ecv

and copy all files of the package and the extracted files to that directory.

Call:

Templates
---------

In template.zip document templates for a german and an english CV can be 
found. Just unzip the template.zip, cd to template and run make to get the
pdf.
