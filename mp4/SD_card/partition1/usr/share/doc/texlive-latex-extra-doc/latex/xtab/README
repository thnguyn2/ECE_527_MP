    The xtab package automatically breaks long tables so that they can
span multiple pages. It is an extension of the supertabular package,
providing additional functionality and reducing some of the weaknesses.
Alternatively, you may find the longtable package fits your needs better.

NOTE: If you have any questions please ask them on the comp.text.tex
      newsgroup where you are likely to get better and faster responses
      than trying to contact me directly as I am away more than I am here.
