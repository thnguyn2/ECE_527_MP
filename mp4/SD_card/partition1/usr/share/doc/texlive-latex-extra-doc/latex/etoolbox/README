ABOUT

The etoolbox package is a toolbox of programming facilities geared
primarily towards LaTeX class and package authors. It provides LaTeX
frontends to some of the new primitives provided by e-TeX as well as
some generic tools which are not related to e-TeX but match the
profile of this package. The package is work in progress. Note that
previous versions of this package were released under the name
elatex.

REQUIREMENTS

This package requires e-TeX.

INSTALLATION

Copy the files 'etoolbox.sty' and 'etoolbox.def' to

	<TEXMFLOCAL>/tex/latex/etoolbox/

where <TEXMFLOCAL> denotes the root of the local TeX installation
tree, for example

	/usr/local/share/texmf/
or
	/usr/share/texmf-local/
or
	C:\Local TeX Files\

The manual ('etoolbox.pdf') goes to

	<TEXMFLOCAL>/doc/latex/etoolbox/

or to any other place where you will find it later.

Note that you may have to create those directories if this is the
first package you're installing locally (as opposed to via a package
manager). Don't forget to update the file hash tables after
installing the files. Please see the TeX FAQ at

	http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

for further details.
