Textpos: absolute positioning of text on the LaTeX page
-------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7f

This package facilitates placing boxes at absolute positions on the
LaTeX page.  There are several reasons why this might be useful, but
the main one (or at least my motivating one) is to help produce a
large-format conference poster.  

This package provides a single environment, plus a starred variant,
which contains the text (or graphics, or table, or whatever) which is
to be placed on the page, and which specifies where it is to be
placed.  The environment is accompanied by various configuration
commands.

For the change history, see textpos.html.


Installation
------------

Download the files textpos.dtx and textpos.ins.  Run LaTeX on the file
textpos.ins -- this will create the files

    textpos.sty
    textpos.drv

Install textpos.sty somewhere TeX will find it.  Run LaTeX on file
textpos.drv to produce instructions and documentation.

This package requires the services of Martin Schr\"oder's package
everyshi.  You will need to download this package from CTAN first.  See
\url{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/ms/} 
or one of the other CTAN hosts.
