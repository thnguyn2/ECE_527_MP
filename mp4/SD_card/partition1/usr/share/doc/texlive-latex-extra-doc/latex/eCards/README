eCards Pacakge: Version 1.0

The eCards package for LaTeX enables you to create a series of
electronic (flash) cards. The demo file for this package is named
eCardstst.pdf. The document author provides questions, hints and
answers to a series of questions. Users can test their knowledge
by responding to the questions. The questions are delivered in
random order.

The distribution:
    eCards.zip : All the files you need except for
        the manuals.
    eCardsman.pdf : An onscreen version of the manual.
        The manual is somewhat terse, most concepts are
        illustrated in the demo file eCardstst.tex, provided
        in eCards.zip.
    eCardsman_p.pdf : a printable version of eCardsman.pdf.
    eCardstst.pdf : The pdf version of the demo file.

Note: This package requires the AcroTeX eDucation Bundle.

Enjoy!
