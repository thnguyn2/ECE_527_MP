LaTeX package hypdvips 2009/03/25 v1.06

The hypdvips package fixes some problems when using hyperref with dvips. It
also adds support for breaking links, hyperlinked tablenotes, file attachments,
embedded documents and different types of GoTo-links. The cooperation of
hyperref with cleveref is improved, which in addition allows an enhanced back-
referencing system.
