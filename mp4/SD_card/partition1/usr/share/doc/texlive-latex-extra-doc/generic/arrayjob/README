  The `arrayjob' package provides array data structures in (La)TeX, in the
meaning of the classical procedural programming languages like Fortran, Ada
or C, and macros to manipulate them. Arrays can be mono or bi-dimensional.

  This is useful for applications which require high level programming
technics, like algorithmic graphics programmed in the TeX language.

  The accompanying documentation file (arrayjob.doc) was written by
Denis Girou <Denis.Girou@idris.fr>.
