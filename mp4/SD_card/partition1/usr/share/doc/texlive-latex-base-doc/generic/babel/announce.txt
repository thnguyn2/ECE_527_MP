	Hi,

	This is the announcement of babel release 3.8,

	What's new in release 3.8?
	Actually babel 3.8 is very much like the later releases of
	babel 3.7. Support for a number of languages has been added. 
	Here is a list of the changes since babel 3.7h:
	- Shorthands are expandable again. The disadvantage is that
	  one has to type '{}a when the acute accent is used as a
	  shorthand character. The advantage is that a number of other
	  problems (such as the breaking of ligatures, etc.) have
	  vanished.
	- Two new commands, \shorthandon and \shorthandoff have
	  been introduced to enable to temporarily switch off one or more
	  shorthands.
	- The support for Hebrew has been updated by Tzafrir Cohen
	- Support for Slovak has been extended with shorthand
	  definitions.
	- Support for typesetting Sanskrit in transliteration will
	  be made available in a later release of babel.
	- Support for typesetting Kannada, Devnagari and Tamil will
	  be made available in a later release of babel.
	- Support for typesetting interlingua is now available, thanks to
	  Peter Kleiweg <kleiweg@let.rug.nl>.

	The last remark: where can you get babel 3.8?
	It is available in the directory
	/tex-archive/macros/latex/rewuired/babel on CTAN.

	Happy LaTeXing!
