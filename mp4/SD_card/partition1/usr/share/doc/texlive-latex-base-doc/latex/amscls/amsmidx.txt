Instructions for using amsmidx.sty

Put these commands in the preamble:

     \usepackage{amsmidx}
     \makeindex{<filename>}

for example:

     \makeindex{subject}
     \makeindex{author}

You may include as many indexes as you need using whatever file names
make sense.  Each \makeindex command will initiate the creation of a
<filename>.idx file.

To identify the index entries in the text:

     \index{<filename>}{index term}

This will populate the .idx files.  Do not leave a space between the
\index entry and the text being indexed; that leaves unsightly spaces
in the output, and may also cause the page number for the index entry
to be different from the page where the term actually appears.

In the backmatter, insert \Printindex commands to print the indexes;
the second argument gives the title to be printed at the top of the
index:

     \Printindex{<filename>}{First Index}
     \Printindex{<filename>}{Second Index}

When the file is processed, files of index terms, <filename>.idx,
will be generated.  To sort the index terms, process the .idx files
separately with Makeindex; this will create <filename>.ind files,
which will in turn be input by \Printindex the next time the .tex file
is processed.

To include a paragraph of comments below the index title, insert the
text as an \indexcomment before the relevant \Printindex:

    \indexcomment{Text of comments}
    \Printindex{<filename>}{...}

The \indexcomment text will be cleared after use.
