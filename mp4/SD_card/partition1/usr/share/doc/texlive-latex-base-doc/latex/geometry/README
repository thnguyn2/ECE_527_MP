----------------------------------
Flexible and easy interface to page dimensions

Copyright (C) 1996-2002, 2008 by Hideo Umeki <latexgeometry@gmail.com>

Abstract:
  This package provides a flexible and easy interface to page dimensions.
  You can set the page layout with intuitive parameters. For instance,
  if you want to set a margin to 2cm from each edge of the paper,
  you can go \usepackage[margin=2cm]{geometry}.

CTAN: macros/latex/contrib/geometry

Release v4.2:
* Fixed check for the definition of \AtBeginShipoutFirst
* Fixed \topskip adjustment so that it works when "lines" option is used.
* Added "driver=none" option, which does nothing for driver.
* Revised the note on "ifvtex" package.
See changes.txt for more history.
