Remember to cover the basics, that is, what you expected to happen and
what in fact did happen.

If the bug (or problem) is triggered by a particular file, you should
try to produce a minimal (the shortest the better) sample file which
triggers the problem and include it in your report.

Your bug report will NOT be automatically sent to the LaCheck upstream
developers.  It will be sent to the Debian Bug Tracking System
<URL:http://bugs.debian.org/> instead, where the Debian lacheck package
maintainer will receive it.  He will eventually forward your report
upstream if he thinks it related to the LaCheck upstream sources rather
than specific to the lacheck package for Debian.

If you think that your bug report is not specifically related to the
Debian package and would like to send it directly to the LaCheck
upstream developers, abort this bug reporting procedure now and follow
the usual bug reporting upstream conventions of LaCheck (look in the
Debian lacheck package documentation directory
"/usr/share/doc/lacheck/").
