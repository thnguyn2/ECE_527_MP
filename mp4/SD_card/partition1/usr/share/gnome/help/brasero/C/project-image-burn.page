  <title>Burn image</title>

  <p><app>Brasero</app> allows you to burn disc images to a CD or DVD. It
  supports the following extensions of optical disc images: <file>.iso</file>,
  <file>.toc</file> and <file>.cue</file>.</p>

  <note style="advanced">
    <p>Disc images are archive files which contain all the data that is on a CD
    or DVD. Only one disc image can be on a CD at a time, but each archive can
    contain as little or as much data as you want, as long as it fits on the
    disc.</p>
  </note>

  <p>To burn a disc image to a CD or DVD, follow these steps:</p>
  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Burn image</gui> on the start page or select
      <guiseq><gui>Project</gui><gui>New Project</gui><gui>Burn imageâ€¦</gui>
      </guiseq>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select a disc image to write by clicking <gui>Click here to select
      a disc image</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the disc that you want to use from drop down list below
      <gui>Select a disc to write to</gui>. If you have more than one disc
      drive, all discs which are currently in them should be listed.</p>
        <note><p>After choosing the disc <app>Brasero</app> shows how much free
        space will remain on the disc after burning.</p></note>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click the <gui>Properties</gui> button to select burning speed and
      other custom options.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Burn</gui> to start burning the image. After this operation
      you can either finish burning or make the other copy of the image.</p>
        <note>
          <p>If you are using a re-writable disc, which already contains data,
          you will be asked if you want to blank it or insert a different
          disc.</p>
        </note>

    <!-- There are some problems with multiple burn. After burning one copy,
    Brasero asks for manual ejecting and then often doesn't detect it. The same
    problem appears by putting inside new CD or DVD - Brasero doesn't always
    detect it. Besides the multiple burn option has the same functionality as
    Burn - they both allow to burn one or several copies, so one option would be
    enough.-->
