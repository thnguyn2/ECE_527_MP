        Edit photos with an external program
    </title>

    <p>
        You might want to use an external editor to do additional work on a photo.
        If installed, GIMP and UFRaw are the default external editors for photo and RAW editing, 
        respectively.  If these programs are not installed, you must select your preferred 
        editors by choosing <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq> and selecting
        editors from drop-down menus of installed applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once your editors have been set, select a photo and choose <guiseq><gui>Photos</gui>
        <gui>Open With External Editor</gui></guiseq> to open the photo with the external editor.
        Likewise, if the original photo is a RAW file, select <guiseq><gui>Photos</gui><gui>Open 
        With RAW Editor</gui></guiseq> to edit the RAW file directly with the set RAW editor.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you complete your edits and save the file, Shotwell will detect the changes and 
        update the photo.   When external edits have been made, press and hold the 
        <key>Shift</key> key in full-window view to show the original photo rather than the 
        externally-edited one.
    </p>
                            
    <p>
        Reverting to original will erase any external edits.
    </p>
    
    <note>
        <p>
            If you externally edit a RAW photo and save the result to another image, such as a
            JPEG or PNG, Shotwell cannot automatically determine that the original RAW and the 
            new image should be paired.
        </p>
            
        <p>    
            If you want to work within the resulting image within Shotwell, you'll need to 
            import it yourself.
