  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p><app>Log File Viewer</app> is a graphical, menu-driven viewer that you can
  use to view and monitor your system logs. <app>Log File Viewer</app> comes
  with a few functions that can help you manage your logs, including a log
  monitor and log statistics display.</p>

  <p><app>Log File Viewer</app> is useful if you are new to system
  administration because it provides an easier, more user-friendly display of
  your logs than a text display of the log file. It is also useful for more
  experienced administrators, as it contains a monitor to enable you to
  continuously monitor crucial logs.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p><app>Log File Viewer</app> is useful only to those who have access to the
    system log files, which generally requires root access.</p>
