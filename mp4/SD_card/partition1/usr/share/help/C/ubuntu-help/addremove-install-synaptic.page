  <title>Use Synaptic for more advanced software management</title>

    <p>
    <app>Synaptic Package Manager</app> is more powerful and can do some software management tasks which 
    <app>Ubuntu Software Center</app> can't. Synaptic's interface is more complicated and doesn't
    support newer Software Center features like ratings and reviews and therefore isn't recommended
    for use by those new to Ubuntu.
    </p>

    <p>
    Synaptic isn't installed by default, but you can <link href="apt:synaptic">install</link> it with Software Center.
