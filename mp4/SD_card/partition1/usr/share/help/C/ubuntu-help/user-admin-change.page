<title>Change who has administrative privileges</title>

  <p>Administrative privileges are a way of deciding who can make changes to
 important parts of the system. You can change which users have admin privileges
 and which ones don't. They are a good way of keeping your system secure and
 preventing potentially damaging unauthorized changes.</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click your name in the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select 
 <gui>User Accounts</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> and enter your password to unlock the account
 settings. (To give a user admin privileges, you must have admin privileges
 yourself.)</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Select the user whose privileges you want to change.</p>
  </item>

 <item>
  <list>
   <item>
    <p>Choose <gui>Administrator</gui> if you want the user to be able to perform administrative tasks, like installing new applications.</p>
   </item>
   <item>
    <p>Choose <gui>Standard</gui> if you don't want the user to be able to perform admin tasks.</p>
   </item>
  </list>
 </item>

 
 <item>
  <p>Close the User Accounts window. The user's privileges will be changed when
 they next log in.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<note>
 <p>The first user account on the system has admin
 privileges. This is the user account that was created when you first installed
 the system.</p>
 <p> It is unwise to have too many users with <gui>Administrator</gui>
 privileges on one system.</p>
