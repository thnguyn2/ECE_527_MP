<title>What is the "Super" key?</title>

  <p>This key can usually be found on the bottom-left of your keyboard,
 next to the <key>Alt</key> key, and usually has a window/squares icon on it. It
 is sometimes called the Windows key, logo key, or system key.</p>

<note>
  <p>If you have an Apple keyboard, there will not be a Windows key on your
 keyboard. The <key>Cmd</key> (Command) key can be used instead.</p>
</note>

  <p>The Super key serves a special function in <em>Unity</em>. If you press the Super key,
  the Dash is displayed. If you press <em>and hold</em> the Super key, an overlay showing
  many of Unity's keyboard shortcuts appears until you release the Super key.</p>

<p>The Super key can help you do even more than that, though. To learn about more uses for the <em>Super</em> key, see the <link xref="shell-keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</link> page.</p>
