  <title>Set up an external monitor</title>
  <p>To set up an external monitor with your laptop, connect the monitor to your laptop.
     If your system doesn't recognize it immediately, or you would like to adjust
     the settings:
  </p>

  <steps>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the menu bar and select <gui>Displaysâ€¦</gui> to open the 
           <gui>Displays Settings</gui>.
  </p></item>

  <item><p>Click on the image of the monitor you would like to activate or deactivate,
           then switch it <gui>ON/OFF</gui>.
  </p></item>

  <item><p>By default, the launcher only shows on the primary monitor. To change which monitor is
           "primary", change the monitor in the <gui>Launcher Placement</gui> drop-down box. You could
           also drag the launcher in the preview to the monitor you want to set as the "primary" monitor.</p>
        <p>If you want the launcher to show on all monitors, change <gui>Launcher Placement</gui> to 
           <gui>All Displays</gui>.
  </p></item>

  <item><p>To change the "position" of a monitor, click on it and drag it to the desired
           position.</p>
           <note><p>If you would like both monitors to display the same content, check the
                    <gui>Mirror displays</gui> box.</p></note>
  </item>

  <item><p>When you are happy with your settings, click <gui>Apply</gui> and then click
           <gui>Keep This Configuration</gui>.
  </p></item>

  <item><p>To close the <gui>Displays Settings</gui> click on the <gui>x</gui> in the top
           corner.
  </p></item>
  </steps>

  <title>Sticky Edges</title>
  <p>A typical problem with dual monitors is that it's easy for the mouse pointer to "slip" to
     the other monitor when you don't want it to. Unity's <gui>Sticky Edges</gui> feature helps
     with that problem by requiring you to push a little bit harder to move the mouse pointer
     from one monitor to the other.</p>

  <p>You can switch <gui>Sticky Edges</gui> off if you don't like this feature.</p>
