  <p>The aim of <app>gnomine</app> is to discover the mines hidden under tiles without make them explose.</p>
  <p>At start, the <app>gnomine</app> board is full of tiles and you have to put flags on those you suspect to have mines.</p>

  <steps>
   <item>
    <p>The games begins with a game board full of tiles, the size of the board depends on the level of difficulty you choose.</p>
   </item>
   <item>
    <p>Click on a first tile to uncover it and discover what's under:</p>
    <list>
     <item><p>A colored number, which represent the number of mines in the adjacent tiles surrounding the current tile. 
     That gives you an indication where mines are, and so where you have to put <link xref="flags"/>.</p></item>
     <item><p>A blank title which means there is no mine around.</p></item>
     <item><p>A mine, in which case you lose.</p></item>
    </list>
   </item>
   <item>
    <p>Do again the previous step until you find all the mines remaining on the board.</p> 
   </item>
  </steps>

  <p>If you were fast enough to complete the game, you'll be invited to add your name in the <link xref="high-scores">high scores</link> list.</p>
