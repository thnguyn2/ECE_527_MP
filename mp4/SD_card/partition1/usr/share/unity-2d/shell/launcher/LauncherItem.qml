/* This component represents a single "tile" in the launcher and the surrounding
   indicator icons.

   The tile is square in size, with a side determined by the 'tileSize' property,
   and rounded borders.
   It is composed by a colored background layer, an icon (with 'icon' as source),
   and a layer on top that provides a "shine" effect.
   The main color of the background layer may be calculated based on the icon color
   or may be fixed (depending on the 'backgroundFromIcon' property).

   There's also an additional layer which contains only the outline of the tile
   that is only appearing during the launching animation (when the 'launching' property is
   true). During this animation the background fades out and the outline fades in,
   giving a "pulsing" appearance to the tile.

   Around the tile we may have on the left a number of "pips" between zero and three.
   Pips are small icons used to indicate how many windows we have open for the current tile
   (based on the 'windowCount' property).
   The rule is: if there's only one window, we just display an arrow. If there are
   two we display 2 pips, if there are 3 or more display 3 pips.

   On the right of the tile there's an arrow that appears if the tile is currently 'active'.

   Additionally, when the tile is marked as 'urgent' it will start an animation where the
   rotation is changed so that it appears to be "shaking".
